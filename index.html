      <p>My name is Sanni Grace and i am quite a number of things. Get me words and i will build a castle because words are building blocks to me.</p>
      <p>Writing was limited to a corner in my room until i saw the ability to reach nations accompant the skill. I have been a creative writer all my life and delving into other aspects of writing as i go has been trilling.</p>
      <p>I am profecient in Script writing, Story telling, Content writing, Content creation, proof reading, Editing and Video making.</p>
      <p>You could also call me a lover of movies. For me, movies are beyond the messages they have to pass. They go so much more into the technicalities and structure behing every scene and picture. The mood, location the scenery, the plot and the theme. When i see a movie, i see the creativity of a multitude of people with different skills working together to produce something beautiful.</p>
      <p>I am a creative and i love to do many things with words. Get me words, and i will build a castle over and over again.</p>
